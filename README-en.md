## Introduction

I've made this repo for store my ``.files`` backup and for sharing them with the public. It was organized following the UNIX folder structure (like you see in your root folder). A short ``tree`` command inside this repository:

```
├── etc
│   ├── bspwm
│   ├── mpd
│   ├── mpv
│   ├── ncmpcpp
│   └── sxhkd
├── img
└── src

```
+ In ``etc`` folder you'll find the config that usually go inside the ``~/.config/`` folder (or whatever your ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` variable is). 
+ ``src/`` is where all my suckless tool is (``dwm`` can be found on another repository).
+ ``img/`` contains the ``README.md`` screenshots and my wallpaper
